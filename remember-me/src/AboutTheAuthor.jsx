                        Janalee Tomaseski-Heinemann worked, laughed, and cried
                        with more than one hundred children who died from cancer
                        and also many survivors during her ten years in
                        pediatric oncology. She is the recipient of the American
                        Cancer Society Service and Rehabilitation Award and the

                        Humanitarian Support of Cancer Programs in the St. Louis
                        Area. This is the book she promised herself, and all her
                        angels in heaven, that she would write before she joins
                        them.
